                        <p>
                            I was studying Information Technology, software development
                            at the Central University of Technology,that is over 5 years ago. Even 
                            though things did not go as planned with jme receiving my diploma, the experience
                            opened me up to the potential the technological sector has, which made
                            me even more enthusiastic about finding my place in it.
                        </p> <br>
                        <h3 class="past">Now</h3>
                        <p>
                            Fast-forward 2019, I stumbled upon Data Science. The ability to work 
                            and produce meaningful insights using technology inhanced by statistical 
                            methods was so enticing I could not resist. In 2021 I ended up applying 
                            for the Data Science program with <a id="umuzi" href="#">Umuzi</a> and I am making a dream a reality, in pursuit of 
                            the Data Scientist accolade.
    
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="past">And in the Future</h3>
                        <p>
                            My honest truth is I see Data Science as a tool with means to achieve. The biggest goal
                            I have is to find a way to help people through the skills I attain in my journey
                            towards being a data scientist. I believe, especially in this beautiful country of ours
                            that there is so much potential for growth and on many different spheres. What would
                            be more pleasing than to be able to gather skills and use them effectively
                            to help improve people and the way in which we live?
